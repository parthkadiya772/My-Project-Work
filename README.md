This project aims to design Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning algorithm to enhance the results of MARIDA: A benchmark for Marine Debris detection from Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. MARIDA provides real events with Marine Debris and contains 15 classes. Initially we will visualize few data to understand its structure and distribution. For visualization I have used histogram visualization method to understand pixel distribution by plotting pixel intensity values, image statistics method to understand distribution of image means and distribution of image standard deviations, pixel value distribution for all images, distribution of class labels to understand distribution of classes, pie chart for distribution of class labels, stacked bar chart of class distributions and t-SNE method.  By preparing block diagram of system engineering, we can be able to design algorithm for results enhancement using spiral approach. In this project I am using Random Forest Regression method, Stochastic Gradient Descent method and Convolutional Neural Network method.
